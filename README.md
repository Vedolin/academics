UIoT is an open-source middleware dedicated to managing services in Internet-of-Things environments. It is designed to transparently allow control of any component able to communicate information. 

Why UIoT
--------

UIoT offers a standardized API with intuitive and simplified ways to add new devices. UIoT is simple, secure and easy to deploy. IoT and the amazing things it can achieve are already known by a lot of people. 

How UIoT works?
---------------

Based on Universal Plug and Play pattern, UIoT discovers all devices which are able to communicate and use then to create an IoT network. UIoT also provides execution capabilities on IoT objects.
